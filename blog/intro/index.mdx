This is the first article of this website. As software engineer, I would be writing stuff related to that field (mmhh or maybe not). For now, I just want to mention the awesome tools I found to build this website.

## Static site generator

- Gatsby
- UPDATE: Moved to Docusaurus on December 2019
- UPDATE: Came back to Gatsby on April 2020
- UPDATE: Moved to my own static site generator on January 2021

## Hosting

- Netlify
- UPDATE: Moved to Digital Ocean on Jan 2021

## Styles

- Plain CSS
- UPDATE: Moved to Tailwind CSS on April 2020
- UPDATE: Plain CSS again on January 2021

Low-level CSS framework that allows me to concentrate in my components and not in css files (in most cases). Tailwind CSS has changed the way I used to see styling stuff and gave me the motivation I needed to explore more about design.

## Final Notes

I am totally new to these technologies, so I might not be using them properly or not aware of all the features they
provide. I simply wanted to start writing, so for now I'll be using platforms and technologies built by more experienced
people, then I'll try to build this site from scratch by my own.

- UPDATE Jan 2021: I decided to use this post to include major changes I'm doing to this site.
