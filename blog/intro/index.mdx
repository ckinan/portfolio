This is the first article of this website. As software engineer, I would be writing stuff related to that field (mmhh or maybe not). For now, I just want to mention the awesome tools I found to build this website.

## Final Notes

I am totally new to these technologies, so I might not be using them properly or not aware of all the features they
provide. I simply wanted to start writing, so for now I'll be using platforms and technologies built by more experienced
people, then I'll try to build this site from scratch by my own.

- UPDATE Jan 2021: I decided to use this post to include major changes I'm doing to this site.
