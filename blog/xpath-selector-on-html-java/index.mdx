title: XPath selector on HTML with Java

slug: xpath-selector-on-html-java
---

I wanted to explore how easy is to extract elements from HTML files or directly from website URLs programatically using Java. I found a third party library that gave me the desired results without much difficulties.

It's XSoup.
- Github Repo: [https://github.com/code4craft/xsoup](https://github.com/code4craft/xsoup)
- Maven Repo: [https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/us.codecraft/xsoup](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/us.codecraft/xsoup)

With XPath expressions it is able to select the elements within the HTML using [Jsoup](https://jsoup.org/) as HTML parser.

In the example below, it extracts the posts of this website using the URL ([https://ckinan.com](https://ckinan.com)) , or reading the html of that exact url but downloaded into the repository.

## The code

Repo: [https://github.com/ckinan/learning/tree/main/java/parse-html](https://github.com/ckinan/learning/tree/main/java/parse-html)

We got:
- One single file `App.java` to place our logic
- One single dependency in our `pom.xml` file: XSoup

### App.java

I tried to explain the code with the docstrings and comments there to point out what the lines and methods are supposed to do.

```java
package com.ckinan;

import org.jsoup.Jsoup;
import org.jsoup.nodes.Document;
import org.jsoup.nodes.Element;
import us.codecraft.xsoup.Xsoup;

import java.io.*;
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Paths;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

    public static final String XPATH_BLOG_POST = "//div[contains(@class, 'leading-snug')]";

        // Calling the static methods that will get an instance of the HTML document and then evaluate
        // the XPath expression to get a list of Blog Posts. First with a HTML file, then do the same with the website

        Document doc1 = App.getDocumentFromFile("src/main/resources/blog.html");
        List<String> postsFromFile = App.readDocument(doc1, App.XPATH_BLOG_POST);
        System.out.println(postsFromFile);

        Document doc2 = App.getDocumentFromUrl("https://ckinan.com/blog");
        List<String> postsFromUrl = App.readDocument(doc2, App.XPATH_BLOG_POST);

                Xsoup.compile(xpath).evaluate(doc).getElements();

        for(Element e: elements) {
            // Each Element object has multiple properties available to be extracted, for example the HTML tag name.
            // For this code snipped, we are interested into extract the text of the element.
            // Example: <p>Hello world</p> -> e.text() would return "Hello world"
            result.add(e.text());
        }

        return result;
    }

}

```

### pom.xml (dependences section only)

```xml
<dependencies>
  <!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/us.codecraft/xsoup -->
  <dependency>
    <groupId>us.codecraft</groupId>
    <artifactId>xsoup</artifactId>

## Testing

Run the `App.java` class, and it should get this printed in the Console:

## Tooling

Something uselful to "test" the XPath expression to see if it's a valid one or if will work, it is this chrome extension: [XPath Helper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xpath-helper/hgimnogjllphhhkhlmebbmlgjoejdpjl). For the above example I introduced the XPath expression `//div[contains(@class, 'leading-snug')]` and ensure the results made sense.

## Final thoughts

I needed an XPath selector, and Xsoup worked well and without a lot of boilerplate, just like what I was looking for. So thanks Xsoup!
