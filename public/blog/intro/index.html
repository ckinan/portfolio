<p>UPDATE Jan 2021: I removed a lot of stuff from my initial setup. Reason: I wanted to create my own static generator script.</p>
<p>This is the first article of this website. As software engineer, I would be writing stuff related to that field (mmhh or maybe not). For now, I just want to mention the awesome tools I found to build this website.</p>
<h2>Gatsby</h2>
<p>Open source technology to build websites, based on React. Nice features and plugins that can help anyone to develop modern sites. What I really loved about it is that it supports markdown for my posts, plus the starters they provide and share to us, which was so nice since I didn't have to build this site totally from scratch.</p>
<ul>
<li>~~UPDATE: Moved to Docusaurus on December 2019~~~</li>
<li>UPDATE: Came back to Gatsby on April 2020</li>
</ul>

<h2>Docusaurus</h2>
<p>~~Moved to Docusaurus. I was looking for a static site generator that allows me to build a portfolio/documentation/blog site and found Gatsby with higher learning curve than Docusaurus. Good reason enough for now.~~</p>
<ul>
<li>UPDATE: Decided to move to Gatsby again on April 2020. Nothing against Docusaurus, actually it was great for getting me started writing my posts, but wanted to give another try to Gatsby.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Netlify</h2>
<p>Platform that gives us a full integrated environment to host a web project. I'm publishing my website to this platform which pulls all my codebase (from Github), build the app and deploy it into a production environment using my own domain. All the infraestructure and deployment-related work are handled by this so useful tool.</p>

<h2>Tailwind CSS</h2>
<p>Low-level CSS framework that allows me to concentrate in my components and not in css files (in most cases). Tailwind CSS has changed the way I used to see styling stuff and gave me the motivation I needed to explore more about design.</p>
<ul>
<li>Link: <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind CSS</a></li>
<li>Introduced in this site with this <a href="https://github.com/ckinan/ckinan.com/commit/8e155916f4908b015f93b64a940b30985e74f45c">commit</a></li>
<li>Post: https://www.ckinan.com/blog/tailwind-css-first-steps</li>
</ul>
<h2>Final Notes</h2>
<p>I am totally new to these technologies, so I might not be using them properly or not aware of all the features they provide. However, for now I am able to rely on few of their products and they're working amazingly.</p>
<p>So, for this first article, I just wanted to point out that building things from scratch is fine, but using platforms and technology built by more expert guys, learn and apply them is even better.</p>
